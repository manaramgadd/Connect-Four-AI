# Connect-Four-AI
Connect 4 is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns
dropping their colored discs from the top into a grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying
the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect-four of
one’s own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The
two players keep playing until the board is full. The winner is the player having greater
number of connected-fours.
#  Game GUI
A full game with GUI with only one mode human vs. computer
where we choose whether to use alpha-beta pruning or not in AI agent then play against the
agent till the board is full. The game dimensions are as follows (width ≥ 7, length ≥ 6).
# Algorithms

You are required to support the following 2 algorithms as options for the AI agent:
• Minimax without alpha-beta pruning

• Minimax with alpha-beta pruning

The agent will run the required algorithm in each turn and it is required to show the minimax
tree in each turn by printing it to the console in a readable form that we can trace. Showing
the tree using GUI will be grant a bonus.
